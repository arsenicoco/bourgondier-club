                <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Supposedly an IT guy. Once a resident of "Mishka Bar" in
                    Saint Petersburg. About 10 years ago, already in Amsterdam,
                    I fell in love with wine and cycling. As it turned out, wine
                    regions are great for cycling, so now I take my bike on
                    trips and bring back boxes of wine.
                </p>
                <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    I know what to look for at auctions and what to find at
                    Dutch wine importers. I'll tell you how to get by without
                    wine education and still enjoy wine. When one winemaker
                    decided I worked in the wine industry, I had to correct him:
                    I work for the wine industry.

                    wine and lose weight. I know how to combine love for wine
                    and travel. Once tried 50 wines in one day without breaking
                    a single traffic rule.
